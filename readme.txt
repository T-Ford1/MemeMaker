the folder res contains saved memes and the wordlist dictionary
mememaker reads the wordlist to search for memes automatically,
but you can change the file to search for anything. The wordlist
consists of about 70,000 english words, so any possible word might
be searched for. Also, mememaker has a custom search option to
search for any meme available on the wide internet, just in case
the random search is not pulling up anything interesting.
